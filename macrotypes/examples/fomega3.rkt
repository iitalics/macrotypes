;; NOTE 2017-02-03: currently not working

; same as fomega2.rkt --- λ and #%app works as both regular and type versions,
; → is both type and kind --- but reuses parts of fomega.rkt,
; ie removes the duplication in fomega2.rkt

;; System F_omega
;; Type relation:
;; - redefine current-kind? and current-type so #%app and λ
;;   work for both terms and types
;; Types:
;; - types from fomega.rkt
;; - String from stlc+reco+var
;; Terms:
;; - extend ∀ Λ inst from fomega.rkt
;; - #%datum from stlc+reco+var

;; types and kinds are now mixed, due to #%app and λ

  ;; eg in the definition of λ or previous type constuctors.
  ;; (However, this is not completely possible, eg define-type-alias)
  ;; So now "type?" no longer validates types, rather it's a subset.
  ;; But we no longer need type? to validate types, instead we can use
